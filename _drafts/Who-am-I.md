Who am I?

I'm Nichollette Taylor Acosta. I am a computer scientist and much more. Earning my B.Sc in Computer Science and minor in Bioinformatics, my focus is around Artifical Intelligence (AI). My strengths are in machine learning and scientific programming. Currenlty I am applying machine learning in the field of neuroinformatics, where I assist my team in research on fMRI data associated with various experiments in nutrition and psychology. Personally I am interested in building AI. I am involved in the research of machine learning and natural language processing, including the algorithms behind this and the ethical implications of building such intelligence. Beyond this, I am an actress, avid reader, and animal lover. I believe in personal responsibilty, conscious living and self improvement. To be apart of something greater than myself is my ambition, and I apire to give rather than receive.
